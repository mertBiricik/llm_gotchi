# Sound Assets

This directory should contain sound files for the LDR Gotchi app.

## Required Files

You can add these sound files to enhance the app experience:

- `beep.mp3` - General sound effect (used for all actions if no specific sounds are available)
- `feed.mp3` - Feeding sound
- `play.mp3` - Playing sound  
- `clean.mp3` - Cleaning sound
- `sleep.mp3` - Sleep sound
- `achievement.mp3` - Achievement unlock sound
- `message.mp3` - Message notification sound

## Format

- Preferred format: MP3
- Keep files small (< 1MB each)
- Short duration (1-3 seconds)

## Notes

If sound files are not present, the app will gracefully handle their absence and continue to function without audio effects.
